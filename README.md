Some of my thoughts:

I added the timeout function to the list sub menu on hover, as WCAG indicated that was better for accessibility for those with mobility issues.

I followed the WCAG specifications for fly-out menus [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/), including the aria attributes.  I need to test this further to ensure keyboard navigation is appropraite & would test it with a screen reader to make sure it is semantically logical and easy to follow.

There are clearly some margin/padding areas that needs to be tinkered with still, especially with the on click Profile sub menu.

I also need to format the mobile menu when it is revealed.  I would add different margins & padding to better render it to the PSD.

I think it would take me another 30-60 minutes to finish it to my liking (slightly perfectionist tendencies ;) ).
